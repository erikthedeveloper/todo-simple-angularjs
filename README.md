# TODO App Simple

What is a good way to really get to know AngularJS. 

Build a project/experiment...
* Without yeoman, a seed project, etc... 
* Pulling in dependencies via bower as needed.
* Hand coding as much as possible

This is that experiment.

Before you judge me, make sure to try it yourself ;)

So far: learned a ton that I haven't learned with the typical **yo angular MyApp** ... **grunt domagic** ... **yo angular:controller MyCtrl** ... etc... workflow
